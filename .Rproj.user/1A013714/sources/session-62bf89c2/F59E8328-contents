## Read in Income2.csv (available on Canvas as well as JWHT Website) and explore the data

```{r}

```

## Treat \texttt{Income} as $Y$ and work on the following questions.<br>

### 1. What is the mean of \texttt{Income}?

```{r}

```



### 2. Examine \texttt{Income} in linear regression with no predictor

```{r}

```

A. How would you put these into a formula?


B. What do you observe? What are the residuals and what do they represent? What are the estimates below Coefficients?


C. How does results from B compare to the mean in #1?


### 3. Examine \texttt{Income} as a fuction of \texttt{Education} in linear regression

```{r}

```

A. How would you put this into a formula?


B. Is the result the same as the one from #2?


### 4. Examine \texttt{Income} as a fuction of \texttt{Education} with no intercept in linear regression

```{r}

```

A. How would you put this into a formula?


B. Is the result the same as the one from #3?


### 5. Examine \texttt{Income} as a function of \texttt{Seniority} in linear regression

```{r}

```

A. How would you put this into a formula?


B. How does this compare to the result in #3?


### 6. Examine \texttt{Income} as a function of \texttt{Education} and \texttt{Seniority} in linear regression

```{r}

```

A. How would you put this into a formula?


B. How does this compare to the result in #3 and #5?


C. What do each of the coefficient estimates mean?


### 7. Do #2-6 make sense?


### 8. Can you use results from #2-6? In what ways?
