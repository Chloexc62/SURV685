## Read in Income2.csv (available on Canvas as well as JWHT Website)

```{r}
inc<-read.csv("D:/111/SURV685/Class 3/Income2.csv") #remember to change your filepath!
dim(inc)
names(inc)
summary(inc)
```

## Treat \texttt{Income} as $Y$ and work on the following questions.<br>

### 1. What is the mean of \texttt{Income}?

```{r}
mean(inc$Income)
```

-   $\bar{Y}=$ `r mean(inc$Income)`

### 2. Examine \texttt{Income} in linear regression with no predictor

```{r}
pred_no<-lm(Income~1,inc)
summary(pred_no)
coef(pred_no)
mean(inc$Income)
```

A. How would you put these into a formula?

-   $Y_i=\bar{Y}+\epsilon_i$

B. What do you observe? What are the residuals and what do they represent? What are the estimates below Coefficients?

-   `summary(pred_no)` returns a single coefficient for the intercept since no predictors were included in the model.
-   The model's residuals can be obtained by `resid(pred_no)`. They represent the difference between the regression line and the observed data points (see lecture 3 slide 31).
-   The estimated intercept coefficient is `r coef(pred_no)`.

C. How does results from B compare to the mean in #1?

-   This is the same as $\bar{Y}=$ `r mean(inc$Income)` from #1.

### 3. Examine \texttt{Income} as a fuction of \texttt{Education} in linear regression

```{r}
pred_edu<-lm(Income~Education,inc)
summary(pred_edu)
coef(pred_edu)
coef(pred_edu)[1]
coef(pred_edu)[2]
```

A. How would you put this into a formula?

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\epsilon_i$, where $X$ is \texttt{Education}

B. Is the result the same as the one from #2?

-   No. There is an intercept coefficient estimated at `r coef(pred_edu)[1]` and a slope coefficient of \texttt{Education} estimated at `r coef(pred_edu)[2]`.

### 4. Examine \texttt{Income} as a fuction of \texttt{Education} with no intercept in linear regression

```{r}
pred_edu_noint<-lm(Income~Education-1,inc)
summary(pred_edu_noint)
```

A. How would you put this into a formula?

-   $Y_i=\beta_1X_i+\epsilon_i$ where $X$ is \texttt{Education}

B. Is the result the same as the one from #3?

-   No. There is no intercept coefficient, and the slope coefficient of \texttt{Education} estimated at `r coef(pred_edu_noint)[1]`.

### 5. Examine \texttt{Income} as a function of \texttt{Seniority} in linear regression

```{r}
pred_sen<-lm(Income~Seniority,inc)
summary(pred_sen)
```

A. How would you put this into a formula?

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_i+\epsilon_i$ where $X$ is \texttt{Seniority}

B. How does this compare to the result in #3?

-   Estimated $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are different than those in #3.

### 6. Examine \texttt{Income} as a function of \texttt{Education} and \texttt{Seniority} in linear regression

```{r}
pred_both<-lm(Income~Education+Seniority,inc)
summary(pred_both)
```

A. How would you put this into a formula?

-   $Y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1X_{1i}+\beta_2X_{2i}+\epsilon_i$ where $X_1$ is \texttt{Education} $X_2$ is \texttt{Seniority}

B. How does this compare to the result in #3 and #5?

-   There is an intercept coefficient and two slope coefficients associated with \texttt{Education} and \texttt{Seniority}, respectively

C. What do each of the coefficient estimates mean?

-   The intercept coefficient, `r coef(pred_both)[1]`, indicates the level of \texttt{Income} under no effect of \texttt{Education} and \texttt{Seniority} (i.e., \texttt{Education}=0 and \texttt{Seniority}=0).
-   The coefficient associated with \texttt{Education}, `r coef(pred_both)[2]`, indicates the change in \texttt{Income} with one unit increase in \texttt{Education}.
-   The coefficient associated with \texttt{Seniority}, `r coef(pred_both)[3]`, indicates the change in \texttt{Income} with one unit increase in \texttt{Seniority}.

### 7. Do #2-6 make sense?

-   Yes, they seem to make sense. The results show that education and seniority are positively associated with income, as one would expect.

### 8. Can you use results from #2-6? Why and why not?

-   The results can potentially be used in many ways. Some examples are to describe the pattern of income as a function of education and seniority, to make policy decisions that will lead to increased income and to predict income of a person with a certain level of education and seniority.
-   The results cannot be used in a causal sense, unless there are established theories to bolster the causal relationship.
